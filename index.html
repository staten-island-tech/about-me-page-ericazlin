    <p>Hello! My name is Erica Lin. I am currently a sophomore attending Staten Island Technical High School and I will be graduating as class of 2025. I was born in New York City and spent a year in China when I was 2 years old. My favorite school subject is English/Writing. I have a pet turtle and an older brother. I listen to music with almost everything I do. Here's one of my favorite <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0rKtyWc8bvkriBthvHKY8d?si=1f86ec3100aa4732">songs</a> as of today, 9/14/2022. I'm not too much of a sports person but here are three sports that I enjoy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tennis</li>
        <li>Volleyball</li>
        <li>Badminton</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm also a big foodie. I prefer savory foods over sweet but I can't turn down a good dessert (especially ice cream!) Here is a list of my top 3 ice cream flavors: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Strawberry</li>
        <li>Matcha/Green Tea</li>
        <li>Milk/Sweet Cream</li>
    </ol>
